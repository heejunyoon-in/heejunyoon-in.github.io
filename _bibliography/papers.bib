  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

    abstract={This thesis explores a novel approach to inspecting IC substrates by integrating twin and single network architectures for fast and accurate defect detection. For inspecting IC substrates, the repetitive nature of the substrates allows comparison-based inspection approaches that detect changed regions between test and reference images. This research proposes a hybrid approach of Combined Twin and Single Network (abbreviated by C-TSNet). We incorporate a single network that is not affected by misalignments and color variations with a twin network, the proposed network achieves robustness to mis-registration while maintaining low computational latency. Additionally, we introduce CC-TSNet, which is extended version of C-TSNet by adding a channel co-attention module to further improve robustness against characteristic differences.}
