## Overview

This paper introduces a method for **action recognition** using **3D point clouds** generated from **Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar signals**. The approach applies **Support Tensor Machine (STM)** to classify various actions based on the 3D spatial and temporal information contained in the point clouds.

## Key Contributions

- **3D Point Cloud Generation**:

  - Applied **3D Capon Beamforming** to generate 3D point clouds from FMCW radar data.
  - Utilized **subsampling** to reduce computational complexity while maintaining accuracy.

- **Action Classification**:
  - Used **Support Tensor Machine (STM)** for classification, achieving an accuracy of **82%** across five distinct actions.
  - Analyzed misclassification cases and identified potential improvements.

## Experimental Setup

- **Radar Sensor**: Texas Instruments IWR6843-ODS
- **Tested Actions**: Sitting, standing, walking, raising hands, squatting.
- **Participants**: 11 individuals performing each action within a 0.5mâ€“2m range from the radar.

## Results

- Achieved **82% accuracy** in classifying five different actions.
- Highlighted key areas for further improvement, such as handling overlapping gesture patterns.

## Conclusion

This research demonstrates the feasibility of using FMCW radar for robust action recognition, providing a cost-effective and privacy-preserving alternative to camera-based systems. {% cite 2023IPIU %}

## Additionally...

- I also worked for fall detection with 3D point cloud with LSTM and RNN structures!
- The most difficult part in radar projects is always getting large amount of datasetðŸ˜‡
