## Overview

This project focused on using **FMCW radar** to generate **3D point cloud data** and applying **RNN** and **LSTM models** for anomaly detection, specifically targeting **fall events**.

## Key Contributions

- Gathered and processed radar data to produce **3D point clouds**.
- Applied advanced deep learning techniques, including:
  - **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**
  - **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks
- Focused on improving anomaly detection performance in safety-critical scenarios such as **fall detection**.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python** and **TensorFlow** for model development and training.
- **MATLAB** for radar data preprocessing and signal analysis.
