## Overview

This project explored a **novel approach for estimating breathing and heartbeat rates** using **3D beamforming-based frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar signals**.

## Key Contributions

- Investigated advanced techniques for vital sign monitoring, leveraging **3D beamforming** to improve signal processing.
- Demonstrated **superior performance** compared to conventional **2D beamforming** methods.
- Focused on enhancing accuracy in the estimation of both **breathing** and **heart rates**.

## Results

- **Research Paper**: Submitted as a second author to an **IEEE conference**. Though rejected, the research showcased promising advancements in radar-based healthcare solutions.
