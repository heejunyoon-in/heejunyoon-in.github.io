## Overview

This project explored a **novel approach for estimating breathing and heartbeat rates** using **3D beamforming-based frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar signals**.

## Key Contributions

- **3D Beamforming**:

  - Focused on different sections of the body for precise vital sign estimation.
  - Improved accuracy over traditional 2D methods in various experimental scenarios.

- **Vital Sign Estimation Framework**:

  - Proposed a method to separate and analyze breathing and heart signals using **Bartlett Beamforming**.
  - Conducted phase extraction and unwrapping to derive vital sign data.

- **Experimental Results**:
  - Validated the method on **seven human subjects**, demonstrating significant improvement in accuracy for both breathing and heart rate detection.

## Results

Our experiments showed:

- **Improved heart rate detection** using the proposed 3D beamforming over conventional 2D methods.
- Lower **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** across varied scenarios.
- **Research Paper**: Submitted as a second author to an **IEEE conference**. Though rejected, the research showcased promising advancements in radar-based healthcare solutions.
