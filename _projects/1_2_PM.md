## Overview

This project was conducted as part of my graduation requirements, focusing on developing a **deep learning-based safety system** specifically designed for **personal mobility devices**.

## Key Features

- Utilized both **user-side** and **roadside images** to monitor and detect various safety factors:
  - Helmet usage
  - Forward-looking behavior
  - Adherence to driving rules on sidewalks and near intersections
- Designed for real-time operation using **Jetson Nano** hardware.

## Role

- **Overall Training**: Developed and trained deep-learning models.
- **Hardware Integration**: Set up and embedded models on **Jetson Nano**.
- **Knowledge Distillation**: Applied knowledge distillation techniques to optimize model performance.

## Results

- Submitted:
  - **One domestic conference paper**.
  - **One international conference paper**.
