## Overview

In 2019, I encountered an article about **Fire Captain Kang Yeon-hee**, whose tragic death highlighted systemic failures in recognizing the sacrifices of Korean firefighters. Captain Kang, a member of the **Inhwa 119 Safety Center in Iksan**, suffered a brain hemorrhage after being assaulted while transporting an intoxicated individual. Despite the clear link between her work and her fatal injury, the **Ministry of Personnel Management** denied her designation as having died in the line of duty, citing a lack of direct evidence. This decision exposed the inadequate institutional support for firefighters facing hazardous conditions.

Moved by this injustice, I initiated a campaign with my team to honor Captain Kang and advocate for systemic reforms to better protect firefighters. Our campaign had three key components:

---

## 1. Interviews with Active Firefighters

We sought firsthand accounts from firefighters, including Captain Kang‚Äôs direct superior, **Firefighter Jeong Eun-ae**. These interviews revealed:

- **Harsh realities** of firefighting, such as insufficient safety measures and the psychological toll of repeated trauma.
- **Institutional challenges**, including limited resources and inadequate training for high-risk situations.
- **Lack of representation** in decision-making processes, such as the government body determining line-of-duty deaths having no members with firefighting experience.

This disconnect underscored the need for systemic reform to ensure firefighters‚Äô experiences and risks were adequately considered.

## 2. Petition for Legislative Reform

We launched a petition titled, "**Demand for Accountability: Support Nationalization of Firefighting Services to Ensure Public Safety**." The petition aimed to pressure lawmakers to revisit the stalled legislation for nationalizing firefighting services.

At the time, firefighting in Korea was managed at the **provincial level**, leading to disparities in funding and working conditions. Nationalization promised a unified system with better resources, training, and protections for all firefighters.

- In just **five days**, we collected over **600 signatures**.
- We compiled the petition into a formal report and delivered it to **Representative Kwon Eun-hee**, urging her to advocate for the bill.

## 3. Awareness and Advocacy on Campus

To expand our campaign‚Äôs reach, we organized awareness activities at our university:

- **Educational Materials**: Distributed infographics and stickers highlighting the risks firefighters face and the importance of systemic reform.
- **Seminar with Firefighter Jeong Eun-ae**: Her stories about the challenges of her profession moved many attendees, fostering deeper understanding and support.
- **Campus Booths**: Engaged students in discussions, distributed advocacy materials, and encouraged them to sign the petition.

## Impact and Reflection

Our campaign gained significant attention, being featured in national news outlets such as **FPN 119** and **The Dong-A Ilbo**. On **November 19, 2019**, we celebrated a historic victory as the legislation for nationalizing firefighting services passed after **47 years**, marking a pivotal step toward improving firefighter safety and working conditions in Korea.

### Personal Growth

This experience profoundly shaped my understanding of the power of **collective action** and **systemic change**. I learned the importance of amplifying marginalized voices and working collaboratively to address structural inequities.

As a researcher, this campaign reinforced my belief in leveraging technology for social good. Whether developing **AI solutions for environmental monitoring** or creating tools to enhance disaster response, I aim to contribute to a more just and sustainable world. This campaign exemplified how technology, guided by empathy and a commitment to social good, can drive meaningful change.
