# Deep Learning-Based Semiconductor Product Inspection

## Overview

For my Master’s degree thesis, I developed a **lightweight twin network-based defect detection system** for **IC substrates**. This system is designed to be robust against mis-registration and characteristic differences, ensuring high accuracy and reliability in real-time semiconductor inspections.

## Objectives

- To design a robust defect detection system for semiconductor inspection.
- To minimize mis-registration errors while maintaining lightweight computational requirements.
- To apply state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for real-time performance.

## Key Contributions

- Developed a **Siamese Network**-based architecture optimized for defect detection.
- Enhanced performance using **Change Detection**, **Attention Mechanisms**, and **Knowledge Distillation**.
- Experimented with **Vision Transformer (ViT)** for improved feature extraction and robustness.

## Technologies and Tools

- **Frameworks**: TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **Key Techniques**:
  - Siamese Networks
  - Change Detection
  - Vision Transformers (ViT)
  - Knowledge Distillation
  - Attention Mechanisms
- **Hardware**: NVIDIA GPUs for accelerated training and inference

## Results

- Achieved state-of-the-art accuracy for defect detection in IC substrates.
- Improved real-time inspection performance compared to traditional methods.
