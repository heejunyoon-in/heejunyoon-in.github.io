## Overview

This project focused on building a custom **Dance Dance Revolution (DDR)** pad using **Arduino Leonardo**. The pad is designed to function as a controller for DDR gameplay by simulating keyboard inputs.

## Key Contributions

- **Hardware Design**:
  - Built the DDR pad structure using MDF boards, copper tape, and aluminum bars.
  - Integrated sensors for directional inputs (up, down, left, right) and connected them to the Arduino Leonardo.
- **Programming**:

  - Wrote custom Arduino code to simulate keyboard input based on sensor readings.
  - Utilized the **Keyboard.h** library to map DDR pad inputs to corresponding keyboard keys.

- **Testing and Debugging**:
  - Verified functionality through various gameplay scenarios and refined input responsiveness.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Arduino Leonardo**: Used for its ability to act as a keyboard.
- **C++**: For programming the microcontroller.
- **MDF Board, Copper Tape, Aluminum Bars**: For constructing the DDR pad.

## Results

- Successfully created a functional DDR pad that responds to gameplay inputs.
- Demonstrated the project via an operating video showcasing its real-time performance.

## Final Thoughts

The project highlights a blend of hardware engineering and programming to create an interactive gaming experience. It was a hands-on exploration of integrating physical computing with game design.
