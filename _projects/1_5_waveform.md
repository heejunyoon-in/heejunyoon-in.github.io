## Overview

This project focused on developing a system for **BPM (Breaths Per Minute) detection** from breathing waveforms using **FMCW Radar**.

## Key Contributions

- Generated breathing waveforms using **FFT** and **Capon Beamforming** techniques.
- Designed and trained a **CNN model** to predict BPM values from the processed waveforms.
- Demonstrated the application of deep learning in radar-based respiratory monitoring.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python** and **TensorFlow** for model development and training.
- **MATLAB** for signal processing and waveform generation.
