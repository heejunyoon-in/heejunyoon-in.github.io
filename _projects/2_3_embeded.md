## Overview

This project focused on designing and implementing a **gesture-based servo control system**. It aimed to improve smart factory automation by recognizing specific gestures and wirelessly transmitting motion data for real-time monitoring.

## Key Contributions

- Developed a system for **recognizing 8 predefined gestures** using **gyro sensors** and controlled servo motors based on these inputs.
- Utilized **XBee wireless communication** to transmit data between the sender and receiver units.
- Designed a system to visualize motion patterns on an LCD based on real-time sensor input.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Arduino Zero**: For controlling servo motors and integrating sensors.
- **MPU6050 Gyro Sensor**: Used for motion detection and analysis.
- **XBee Modules**: Enabled wireless communication between devices.
- **MATLAB**: For data preprocessing and visualization.
