## Overview

This project was developed as part of the **2020 Club Exhibition Project**. It involved designing and constructing a custom **clock featuring LED animations**, combining both hardware and software elements.

This project was based on the [instructables project](https://www.instructables.com/RGB-HexMatrix-IOT-Clock/)

## Key Contributions

- **Hardware Design**:

  - Used **WeMos D1 mini Pro** and **WS2812 LED strip** to create dynamic LED animations.
  - Built a 3D-printed clock frame using **Fusion 360** for modeling and design.

- **Software Development**:
  - Programmed the clock functionality and LED animations using **Arduino**.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Arduino**: For programming the microcontroller and controlling the LED animations.
- **Fusion 360**: For 3D modeling and printing the clock frame.

## Results

- Successfully showcased the project at the **2020 Club Exhibition**, demonstrating interactive LED animations synchronized with the clockâ€™s timekeeping functionality.
