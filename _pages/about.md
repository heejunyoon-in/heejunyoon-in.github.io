### Welcome! üåç

Hello! I'm **Heejun Yoon**, an AI researcher and engineer passionate about advancing AI technologies for real-world impact.
I am currently conducting research at **Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST)**(https://www.kist.re.kr/eng/index.do#secondPage), focusing on AI-driven solutions for Multiview Vision-Language Models.
I earned my **bachelor's and master's degrees in electrical engineering** from [Ewha Womans University](https://www.ewha.ac.kr/ewhaen/index.do).

#### What Drives Me ‚ú®

Whether it's solving complex problems, exploring cutting-edge technologies, or working on collaborative projects, I‚Äôm always motivated by a love for transforming advanced data insights into meaningful, real-world applications. I‚Äôm particularly interested in:
- **[Adaptive AI Systems for Dynamic Environments]:** By integrating digital twin technologies and continual learning, I aim to develop adaptive AI systems that swiftly respond to real-time changes, ensuring transparency and effective performance in dynamic industrial environments.
- **[Reliable AI for Manufacturing and Beyond]:** Moving beyond black-box, fostering transparency in AI decision-making processes to identify biases, ensure fairness, and promote reliable, trustworthy deployments of responsible and equitable AI systems.


#### The Journey So Far üöÄ

My journey began with a fascination for optimizing complex systems to enhance human life. During my master‚Äôs research, I specialized in **machine vision**, building adaptable and efficient deep learning architectures for inspecting semiconductor products. As an undergraduate, I explored **FMCW radar signal processing** ‚Äì tackling challenges in people counting, motion recognition with 3D point clouds, and vital sign monitoring. These experiences have shaped my drive to push technological boundaries, ensuring that progress remains aligned with sustainability and social good.

#### My Mission üå±

I aim to develop AI systems that not only drive innovation but also improve lives by creating **responsible and sustainable technologies**.  
Whether it's through collaborating with industry leaders, sharing my research, or mentoring the next generation, I am committed to making a **positive, lasting impact**.

If you're curious about my research, upcoming projects, or just want to connect, feel free to contact via [e-mail](mailto:hjyoon9808@gmail.com) or LinkdIn(heejun-yoon).
Looking forward to sharing my work and insights with you!
