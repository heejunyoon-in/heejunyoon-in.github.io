### Welcome to My Research World üåç
Hello! I'm **Heejun Yoon**, a passionate AI researcher and engineer with a passion for using technology to solve real-world challenges. I hold a bachelor's and master's degree in electrical engineering from [Ewha Womans University](https://www.ewha.ac.kr/ewhaen/index.do).


#### The Journey So Far üöÄ
My journey began with a fascination for optimizing complex systems to enhance human life. During my master‚Äôs research, I specialized in **machine vision**, building adaptable and efficient deep learning architectures for inspecting semiconductor products. As an undergraduate, I explored **FMCW radar signal processing** ‚Äì tackling challenges in people counting, motion recognition with 3D point clouds, and vital sign monitoring. These experiences have shaped my drive to push technological boundaries, ensuring that progress remains aligned with sustainability and social good.

#### What Drives Me ‚ú®
Whether it's solving complex problems, exploring cutting-edge technologies, or working on collaborative projects, I‚Äôm always motivated by a love for transforming advanced data insights into meaningful, real-world applications. I‚Äôm particularly interested in:
- **[Deep Learning for Monitoring]:** Developing machine learning models to detect and track changes from product quality control to ecosystem health, supporting biodiversity and conservation efforts.
- **[Ethical AI and Sustainable Technology]:** Exploring responsible AI practices that promote sustainability and reduce environmental impact, ensuring that technology serves societal and ecological well-being.
- **[Model Adaptation]:** Advancing deep learning techniques to ensure models remain effective in dynamic environments, adapting to new data and scenarios with minimal retraining.

#### My Mission üå±
Through my work, I aim to make complex data accessible and actionable and push the boundaries of ethical AI practices. I firmly believe that technology should be developed responsibly and used for the greater good.

If you're curious about my research, upcoming projects, or just want to connect, feel free to contact via [e-mail](mailto:hjyoon9808@gmail.com) or LinkdIn(heejun-yoon).
Looking forward to sharing my work and insights with you!
